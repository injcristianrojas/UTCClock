# UTCClock (legacy version)

## Intro

I just wanted to see UTC time on my GNOME Shell desktop,
[just as mibus did](https://github.com/mibus/MultiClock).

This branch will be primarily for support (bug correction) for GNOME versions 3.30 and earlier.

## Install

Download the code and install it:

```
git clone https://github.com/injcristianrojas/UTCClock.git
cd UTCClock
make install
```

Depending if you have Wayland or not, you will have to log out and then log back in.
